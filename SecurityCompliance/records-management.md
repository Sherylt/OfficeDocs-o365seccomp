# Records management in Microsoft 365

Organizations of all types require a records-management solution to manage business, legal, and HR records across their corporate data. Records management in Microsoft 365 helps an organization manage their legal obligations, provides the ability to demonstrate compliance with regulations, and increases efficiency with regular disposition of  items that are no longer of value or no longer required for business purposes.

The records-management solution supports the following elements: 

- 	**Migrate and manage your retention plan with file plan** and use [file plan manager](file-plan-manager.md) to bring in your existing retention plan, or build new with file descriptors and expanding hierarchies.

- 	**Establish retention and deletion policies within the record label**. Define [retention](retention-policies.md#retaining-content-for-a-specific-period-of-time) and [disposition](retention-policies.md#deleting-content-thats-older-than-a-specific-age) periods based on a variety of factors including the date last modified or created.

- 	**Label as a record**. Publish [record labels](labels.md#using-retention-labels-for-records-management) to be applied by end users, or [auto-apply record labels](labels.md#applying-a-retention-label-automatically-based-on-conditions) to items containing specific sensitive information, keywords or content types.

- 	**Trigger event-based retention** with [event-based retention](event-driven-retention.md).

- 	**Review and validate disposition** with [disposition review](disposition-reviews.md).

- 	**Review disposed items with disposition review** and [export a disposition report](disposition-reviews.md#export-the-disposition-items) for further validation and reporting.

- 	**Set specific permissions** for records manager functions in your organization to [have the right access](permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center.md).

With the records-management solution in Microsoft 365, you can incorporate your organization’s retention schedules into the file plan to manage retention, records declaration, and disposition in support of the full content lifecycle.
